Why We need Linear Regression?

Linear regression is going to provide outcome prediction with the 
help of mathematical relationship between input features and the target outcome

Its designed to predict continuous outcomes rather than the binary values

This is the baseline model. That means this is the first model we can start with. If this is not satisfying the problem requirements , more complex models can be explored

What is the Advantage Of Linear Regression compared with the other ML models?

1. Linear regression quantify clearly how much a given feature is impacting the prediction using interpretable predictions
2. Linear regression can even work with small and medium data sets and doesn't require large amounts of data
3. Due to its transperent mathematical structure linear regression strongly supports debugging, explainability and interpretability
