Google street view blurring system
    The requirement here is given an image we need to blurr the privacy regions in the image
    That means we need to blurr the faces of people, we need to blur the licence plates of cars,
    we need to blur the house numbers in the images etc.

    Here we have limited training data. Hence we need to have more accuracy than the prediction time
    Thats why we have chosen a 2 stage ML model. 
    Where we initially use CNN Resnet50() to extract image features, like edges and corners of the image
    After that we use 2 stage process
    In stage-1 we detect the object location in the image by using linear regression
    In stage-2 we classify the object into one of the multiple object list we have
    After that we take decision to blur the image or not
    Finally we show the image 
    Stage-1 is called RPN: Region Proposal Network
    Stage-2 is called ROI Head ( Region Of Interest Head )

    Before going to stage-1 and stage-2 following operations are done
    CNN and RPN operates 2D feature space to extract features and locate Objects
    After this ROI pooling convert 2D space into fixed size 1D representation
    After this inside ROI fully connected layers perform multiclass classification with 
    softmax applied internally
